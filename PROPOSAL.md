## Description and Motivation
In this project, I am going to build a personal portfolio page that describes who I am, what skills I have, and the work I have done. The motivation is to differentiate myself
from others with a portfolio that describes myself as a person, my skills, and the work/projects I have done. The reason why I am building a portfolio is for future employers
to see my website to get to know me better as a person and what I can provide to a team within the company.

## Prior Art
This project will be based off my experiences with html/css that I have learned over the course of 5 weeks.

## Core User Workflows
Things on my website a user should be able to do include: Selecting a tab on the nav-bar to go to a certain place on the website, Selecting one
of the ways to contact me either via email, github, linkedin, or phone, and being sent to a link of projects/work I have done over the course of 15 weeks.

## Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals
#### Tuesday: 
HTML code should be done by the end of Tuesday with the small chance of some CSS code dealing with color and font should be implemented.

#### Wednesday: 
Major CSS changes added to the repository which include nav-bar, links to project pages, links to social media/how to contact me, and some editing
on where things are centered such as the nav bar and certain areas of content being sectioned off.

#### Thursday: 
Complete centering/sectioning off areas on the website and making sure any bugs are fixed/everything is in working order.

## Friday Daily Goals
Provide a helpful READme about my project.
